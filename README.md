# What does it mean?

Meditation in blocks measured against target time. Also measuring the number of twitches or movements per block.  

Other edifying exercises including psychotheraputic exercerise, philosophy, and other books given in top.

Since overall goal is to disconnect from daily activities and especially communication the deviances are given in black. This could be summarized as "time on phone"

# More specifically?

About 8 books read, mostly Ursala Le Guin (Earthsea first four books), Camille Palglia (three books of hers I hadn't read before), and some Schelling and Oscar Wilde, including an exercise where I wrote out all the answers to the "Know Yourself" deck from school of life (https://www.amazon.com/Know-Yourself-Prompt-Cards-Exploration/dp/1915087724).  

# What does it do?

Calms the mind, enhances powers of concentration, stuff like this
